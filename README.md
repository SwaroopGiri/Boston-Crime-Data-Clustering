# Boston-Crime-Data-Clustering


Crime is unfortunately unavoidable and with the city of Boston releasing Crime related data to the public, we can use Data Science and Machine Learning techniques to help mitigate future crimes. The following data consists of the various crimes reported throughout the city of Boston from January 2022 to June 2022. The dataset was taken from boston open data, which was provided by Boston Police Department(BPD).

In this project, we'll be analysing the dataset and cluster regions in Boston based on crime rate using K-means
